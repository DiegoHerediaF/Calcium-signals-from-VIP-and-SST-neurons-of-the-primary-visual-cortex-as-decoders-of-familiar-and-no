# Calcium-signals-from-VIP-and-SST-neurons-of-the-primary-visual-cortex-as-decoders-of-familiar-and-no
2022 Neuromatch Academy (NMA) project on AllenSDK database  The following work aims to demonstrate whether, from the recording of the calcium activity of V1 cortex neurons in mice, a computational model capable of predicting the calcium dynamics of a novel or familiar image can be generated.
